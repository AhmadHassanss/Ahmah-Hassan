                            has founded several successful companies, including Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring
                            Company. He was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa.

                            Musk moved to the United States in the 1990s and attended the University of Pennsylvania,
                            where he earned degrees in physics and economics. He then co-founded Zip2, a company that
                            provided business directories and maps to newspapers, which was eventually sold for nearly
                            $300 million.

                            Musk went on to co-found PayPal, an online payment system, which was later acquired by eBay
                            for $1.5 billion. He then turned his attention to space exploration and founded SpaceX in
                            2002, with the goal of making space travel more affordable and accessible.</p>

                        Imran Khan is a Pakistani politician, former cricketer, and current Prime Minister of Pakistan.
                        He was born on October 5, 1952, in Lahore, Pakistan.

                        Khan began his cricketing career in the 1970s and quickly became one of Pakistan's most
                        successful cricket players. He led the national team to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup,
                        which remains one of Pakistan's greatest sporting achievements.

                        After retiring from cricket, Khan became involved in politics and founded the Pakistan
                        Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) political party in 1996. He ran for the office of Prime Minister multiple
                        times but was unsuccessful until the 2018 general election, when his party won a majority of
                        seats in the National Assembly, and he was sworn in as Prime Minister in August 2018.</p>

                        independence of India from British colonial rule. He became a key figure in the All India Muslim
                        League and advocated for the creation of a separate Muslim state in India, which ultimately led
                        to the creation of Pakistan in 1947.</p>
